*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these different variables. Unless we're careful and thorough, we can easily miss these patterns. In this challenge you'll analyze a dataset with a small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations | Documented observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Team
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Documented | No team contributions to Wiki | Team contributed to Wiki |
| Referenced | No team references in Wiki | At least one reference in Wiki to member report(s) |
| Relevant | References unrelated to assertion, or difficult to find related analysis based on reference text | Reference text clearly points to relevant analysis |

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about 67% of its passengers died.

# First Look
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

__q1__ Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
df_titanic %>%
  glimpse()
```

**Observations**:
- Variable: Class, Sex, Age, Survived, n


__q2__ Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of passengers. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

```{r q2-summary}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

**Observations**:

- Wikipedia page say an estimate of 2224 people were aboard. This is slightly more than the number reported above. It seems like there was uncertainty in the numbers of the overall passenger list (people who canceled their trip last minute and/or traveled under aliases). 

__q3__ Create a plot showing the count of passengers who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>% 
  ggplot() +  #Started
    geom_point(aes(x = Class, y = n, color = Sex))
    # geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = n, color = Sex))

```

**Observations**:

- In each most of the classes, more females survived than males. It's curious that the 3rd class has almost the same number of females and males that survived. It's also fascinating that more male crew members survived than women. I wonder why. Where there more on board?

# Deeper Look
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for understanding differences between groups. This is because the differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.[1]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age` group.

```{r compute-prop}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

__q4__ Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3.

```{r q4-task}
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes" & !is.na(Prop)) %>%
  ggplot() +  #Started
    geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = Prop)) +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(Sex))
```

**Observations**:

- Proportionally, the figure above suggests that the higher the class, the most likely to survived. In every class, more women proportionally survived than males. However, I wonder about the 1st and second class males having a higher survival rate than the women in 3rd class and crew.

__q5__ Create a plot showing the group-proportion of passengers who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don't forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider additional variables!

```{r q5-task}
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == "Yes" & !is.na(Prop)) %>%
  ggplot() +  #Started
    geom_col(stats = "Identity", aes(x = Class, y = Prop)) +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(Sex), cols = vars(Age))  
```

**Observations**:

- Adult male passengers seem significantly less likely to survive. The affect of the 1st and 2nd class men having a higher survival rate seems to be only due to the 
- Why did children in the 3rd class have a much lower survival rate than 1st and 2nd class. Women and children first... to an extent...
- Were there enough life boats to actually save all of the women and children? Could the life boats have saved more people?
- Why more crew men survived than 2nd and 3rd class men?

# Notes
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

[1] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
